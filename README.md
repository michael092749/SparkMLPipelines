# SparkMLPipelines

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates an advanced data science pipeline using Apache Spark, focusing on document clustering with K-means. The project showcases various aspects of big data processing, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Key Features:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Implement effective techniques to prepare raw news articles for analysis.
- **K-means Clustering**: Apply PySpark's MLLib implementation of K-means to group news articles into coherent categories.
- **Optimal K Selection**: Utilize the elbow method to empirically determine the best number of clusters.
- **Cluster Evaluation**: Assess cluster quality using standard validity measures like silhouette coefficient.
- **PySpark ML Pipelines**: Showcase the use of PySpark's machine learning pipelines for streamlined data processing and model training.
- **Data Visualization**: Employ various techniques to visualize the clustering results and other relevant insights.

This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for data scientists and machine learning engineers working with large-scale text data, demonstrating the power and flexibility of Apache Spark for complex data processing tasks.
